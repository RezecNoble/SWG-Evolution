# SWG-Evolution
SWG: Evolution is a new take on SWG based on the SWG-Source project and will also make use of content from SWG-Expanded. This is an open source project.

- This project is inspired by the work that Aconite and RisTanA were doing for SWG: Redemption.

- This server will have a multi-class system that takes elements from both the NGE and CU.

- This is not a downgrade to the CU, but an evolution of both systems.
